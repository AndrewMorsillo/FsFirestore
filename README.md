## 2. Usage

#### Connect to Firestore

To use any of the Firestore features you have to initialize the connection via a Service Account JSON (either for [Firebase](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/settings/serviceaccounts/adminsdk) or [GCP](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/getting-started)).

```fsharp
open FsFirestore.Firestore

let connectToFirestore =
	let didWeConnect = initFirestore "./path/to/your/service_account.json"
```

The `initFirestore` function returns a boolean, to indicate whether the connection could be established.

#### Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD)

After your successfully connected to your Firestore DB you can start manipulating data.

For better handling within the API we added a generic retrieval functions, to simply retrieve your wanted model. Sadly the Googles .NET API only let's us use classes, to compensate we created a base class that can be used to make your life easier.

```fsharp
open Google.Cloud.Firestore
open FsFirestore.Types

[<FirestoreData>]
type Address() =
	inherit FirestoreDocument() // This is the base class that comes with FsFirestore
	
	[<FirestoreProperty>]
	member val Street = "Pennsylvania Avenue" with get, set

	[<FirestoreProperty>]
	member val HouseNo = 1600 with get, set
	
	[<FirestoreProperty>]
	member val City = "Washington" with get, set
	
	[<FirestoreProperty>]
	member val State = "DC" with get, set

// Because of the inheritance we now have some niffty features in this straight forward model class.
let address = new Address()

// We can retrieve all fields in a object list, which can later be used to query the DB.
let fields = address.fields // => ["Pennsylvania Avenue"; 1600; "Washington"; "DC"]

// We can ask the model, which in turn is a document in our Firebase DB which ID and Collection it belongs to, this is only true when retrieved via generic read function from FsFirestore.
let docId = address.id
let collectionId = address.collectionId
```

#### Let's read from the Firestore DB 

```fsharp
open FsFirestore.Firestore

// Let's read an address from the DB and automatically convert it to our model.
let address = document<Address> "addresses" "address-id"

let docId = address.id // => address-id
let collectionId = address.collectionId // => addresses

// ---

// Let's just retrieve the document reference...
let addressRef = documentRef "addresses" "address-id"
// When can if we wanted to then also convert it to our model type, so we would have the same as above.
let address = convertTo<Address> addressRef
```
